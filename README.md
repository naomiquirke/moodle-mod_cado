# moodle-mod_cado
Moodle mod to enable teachers to automatically generate a curriculum report (aka a "CADO" = Course Assessment and Delivery Outline) from a regular Moodle course for students to use.  
In addition, the mod provides the ability for courses to be compared using the CADOs, and provides an approval workflow system so that different roles can be set up to generate, compare or approve the CADOs.  

The CADO absorbs information from the forum, assignment and quiz modules, including grading rubrics and completion criteria. It uses the tag system for other specified activity related information.  It also offers three CADO-specific text areas, and one site-specific text area, for additional information that is not normally held within Moodle activities.
