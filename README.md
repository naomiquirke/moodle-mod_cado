# moodle-mod_cado
This Moodle module enables teachers to automatically generate a curriculum report (aka a "CADO" = Course Assessment and Delivery Outline) from a regular Moodle course.  With an approved CADO, students can easily navigate their course requirements and link to important activities.  The CADO absorbs information from the forum, assignment and quiz modules, including user grouping, grading rubrics and completion criteria. It uses the tag system for custom activity related information.  It offers three CADO-specific text areas and one site-specific text area for custom information not normally held within Moodle activities.  

In addition, the mod provides an approval workflow system.  Different roles can be set up to generate, compare or approve the CADOs, with alerts and messaging at the completion of each stage in the workflow. Upon approval, students may view the CADO, and further editing is disabled.

Course variants, such as those created by different user groupings, or caused by changes in assessments, are able to be compared using different CADOs, with section differences highlighted visually.

All the terminology within the report, including "CADO", is able to be customized using Moodle's language settings.

Updates
=======

Version 2.0
-----------
* The Moodle Mobile app will now display an approved CADO, or if CADO is not approved, display a message to say that it is unavailable.
* Viewing of the approved CADO is now logged, so access may be evaluated in the standard course participation report, and students who have not viewed the CADO may be messaged through that standard process.
* CADO format: missing colon added in forum due date.
